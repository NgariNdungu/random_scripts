A graph G, is composed of vertices V and edges E
G = (V, E) where V is a set of vertices and E, a set of edges
each edge is a tuple (v, w, W) where W is the weight
a vertex has a name("key") and additional information

implementation using an adjacency list
two classes, Vertex and Graph 
the Vertex class:
initializes a new vertex with an id and an empty dict of neighbours
methods to, addNeighbour, getNeighbour, getWeight given a neighbour as input, getConnections
how to using TDD?
